There are some sample files here to help you get correct output,
broken down into two types and two sizes.  The "no-tnt" tiles
have no TNT in them: all tiles are either already cleared (0)
or have rubble.  The "normal" test files have TNT, rubble, etc.

Each type of test files includes two sizes, small (around size 10)
and large (around size 1000).

There are R and equivalent M mode input files for each combination.

There are also output files, one for each input type and size.
There's no need to have output files for R or M input; since the
input files are equivalent, you should get the same output no matter
which input file mode you use.
