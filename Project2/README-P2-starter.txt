You can use the commands "make alltests" or "make testPQ" to try out the
priority queue tester, however this will only work if your project2.cpp
file exists.

There are two versions of the Unordered priority queue: UnorderedPQ.h and
UnorderedFastPQ.h.  The 'fast' version uses a mutable member variable to
change the majority of calls to pop() from O(n) to O(1).  Both versions
are complete, and can be used as an example of how to use this->compare.
